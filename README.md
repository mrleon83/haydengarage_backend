# haydengarage_backend

Tech requirements - Docker, PHP 8.1.0

This repository creates the backend for the application. I did begin using Inertia to handle the front end but aborted this due to an issue with dynamic content, the backend and frontend is now seporated.

To run

install dependancies - composer install

run project locally using sail - ./vendor/bin/sail up

migrate the database - ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
